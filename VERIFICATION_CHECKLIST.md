## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Start the backend server (`cd server && npm start`)
- [ ] Start the frontend (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Login as employee (employee@hrms.com / password123)
- [ ] Navigate to Leave Management page
- [ ] Verify leave balance shows 999 days for all types
- [ ] Apply for leave with large number of days (e.g., 30 days)
- [ ] Verify leave request is created successfully
- [ ] Verify no error about insufficient balance

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Run the test script: `node test-unlimited-leave.js`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check that leave balance shows 999 days
- [ ] Confirm 30-day leave request succeeds

### Database Testing
- [ ] Run seed script: `cd server && node utils/seed.js`
- [ ] Verify seeded employees have 999 days for all leave types
- [ ] Create new employee via UI
- [ ] Verify new employee has 999 days for all leave types

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Request 100+ days of leave
- [ ] Request leave that spans multiple months
- [ ] Approve/reject leave and verify balance updates correctly
- [ ] Delete pending leave and verify balance updates correctly

## 📊 Expected Results

### Leave Balance Display
```
Annual: 999 days (or 999 - used - pending)
Sick: 999 days (or 999 - used - pending)
Casual: 999 days (or 999 - used - pending)
Unpaid: 999 days (or 999 - used - pending)
```

### Leave Request Form
- No "days left" shown in dropdown
- No validation error for large day counts
- Only validates start/end date logic

### Leave Balance Card
- Shows remaining days as: 999 - used - pending
- Progress bar shows usage relative to 999 days
- Displays used and pending days correctly

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (if needed)

If you need to restore the original limits:

1. **server/utils/seed.js**: Change 999 back to 20, 10, 5, 99
2. **data/mockData.ts**: Change 999 back to 20, 10, 5, 99
3. **components/LeaveApplyForm.tsx**: Restore validation code
4. **components/leave/LeaveApplyForm.tsx**: Restore validation code
5. Re-run seed script to update database

## 📝 Notes

- The value 999 is used instead of removing the field entirely to maintain compatibility
- The system still tracks used and pending days correctly
- Leave approval/rejection workflow remains unchanged
- Reporting and analytics continue to work as before
