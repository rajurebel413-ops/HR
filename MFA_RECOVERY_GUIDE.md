# 🔐 MFA Recovery System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
When users lose access to their authenticator app (phone lost, app deleted, new device), they can now recover their account through multiple secure methods.

## 🛡️ **Recovery Methods Available**

### 1. **Email-Based MFA Recovery** 📧
- User requests MFA recovery via email
- Secure recovery link sent to registered email
- Link expires in 1 hour for security
- Option to change password during recovery
- Complete MFA reset (user needs to set up MFA again)

### 2. **Backup Codes** 🔑
- 10 single-use backup codes generated after MFA setup
- Each code can only be used once
- Stored securely (hashed) in database
- Can be downloaded/copied for safe storage
- Used as alternative to authenticator app

### 3. **Admin Recovery** (Future Enhancement) 👨‍💼
- HR/Admin can reset user's MFA
- Audit trail for security compliance
- Emergency access for critical situations

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Email Recovery Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Lost access to authenticator?" on login
2. Enters email address
3. System sends recovery email with secure token
4. User clicks link in email
5. Optional: Set new password
6. MFA is reset, user can login normally
7. User must set up MFA again for security
```

### **Backup Code Flow:**
```
1. User sets up MFA normally
2. System suggests generating backup codes
3. User generates and saves 10 backup codes
4. If authenticator is lost, user can use backup code
5. Each code works only once
6. User should generate new codes when running low
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Details**

### **Backend Routes Added:**
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/recovery-request` - Request recovery email
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/recovery-verify/:token` - Verify recovery token
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/backup-codes` - Generate backup codes
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify-backup` - Login with backup code

### **Database Schema Updates:**
```javascript
// User model additions
mfaRecoveryToken: String,     // Hashed recovery token
mfaRecoveryExpire: Date,      // Token expiration
mfaBackupCodes: [String]      // Hashed backup codes
```

### **Frontend Components Added:**
- `MfaRecoveryPage.tsx` - Request recovery email
- `MfaRecoveryVerifyPage.tsx` - Complete recovery process
- `BackupCodesPage.tsx` - Generate and display backup codes
- Enhanced `MFAVerificationPage.tsx` - Backup code option

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Email Recovery Security:**
- ✅ Recovery tokens are cryptographically secure (32 bytes)
- ✅ Tokens are hashed before storage
- ✅ 1-hour expiration for time-limited access
- ✅ Single-use tokens (deleted after use)
- ✅ No user enumeration (same response for valid/invalid emails)
- ✅ Audit logging for security monitoring

### **Backup Codes Security:**
- ✅ Codes are cryptographically random (4 bytes each)
- ✅ Codes are hashed before storage (SHA-256)
- ✅ Single-use codes (deleted after use)
- ✅ 10 codes provide reasonable backup access
- ✅ Codes are only shown once during generation

## 📧 **Email Templates**

### **Recovery Email:**
- Clear subject: "MFA Recovery Request"

   - Test token reuse prevention

### **Backup Codes Testing:**
1. **Code Generation:**
   - Generate backup codes after MFA setup
   - Verify codes are unique and random
   - Test download/copy functionality

2. **Code Usage:**
   - Use backup code for login
   - Verify code is consumed (single-use)
   - Test invalid code handling

## 📱 **Mobile Considerations**

### **Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-friendly recovery forms
- Touch-friendly backup code display
- Easy copy/share functionality on mobile
- Clear typography for code readability

### **App Integration:**
- Deep links for recovery emails
- Clipboard integration for backup codes
- Biometric authentication where available

## 🔄 **Recovery Process Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Lost Phone**
```
User: "I lost my phone with the authenticator app"

2. Clicks "Lost access to authenticator?"
3. Enters email address
4. Checks email and clicks recovery link
5. Optionally sets new password
6. MFA is reset, can login normally
7. Sets up MFA again on new device
```

### **Scenario 2: Using Backup Code**
