## Impact

### Before
- Annual Leave: 20 days limit
- Sick Leave: 10 days limit
- Casual Leave: 5 days limit
- Unpaid Leave: 99 days limit
- System prevented leave requests exceeding available balance
- Leave type dropdown showed remaining days

### After
- All Leave Types: Unlimited (999 days)
- No validation preventing leave requests based on balance
- Leave type dropdown shows only the leave type name
- Employees can request any number of leave days
- Leave balance tracking still works (used/pending/remaining)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test leave request creation with various day counts
2. Verify leave balance display shows unlimited days (999)
3. Test that leave approval/rejection still updates balances correctly
4. Verify new employee creation assigns unlimited leave balance
5. Test database seeding creates employees with unlimited leave

## Notes

- The leave balance tracking system remains intact
- Used and pending days are still tracked
- The system still calculates and displays remaining days (999 - used - pending)
- All existing leave requests and balances are preserved
- No database migration needed as the system uses the same schema
