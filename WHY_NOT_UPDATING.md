# Why Dashboard & Attendance Are Not Updating

## The Problem

You're seeing static data because **the frontend hasn't been restarted** to load the new code changes.

## What We Changed

1. **App.tsx** - Added 10-second auto-refresh
2. **DashboardPage.tsx** - Added 10-second auto-refresh  
3. **AttendancePage.tsx** - Added API integration and auto-refresh

## Why It's Not Working

The frontend is still running the **OLD CODE** from before these changes were made.

### Current State:
- ❌ Frontend running old code (no auto-refresh)
- ❌ Dashboard showing static numbers
- ❌ Attendance not syncing
- ❌ Changes not visible

### After Restart:
- ✅ Frontend runs new code (with auto-refresh)
- ✅ Dashboard updates every 10 seconds
- ✅ Attendance syncs across users
- ✅ All changes visible in real-time

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Use the Restart Script (Easiest)

1. **Close all running terminals** (Ctrl+C in each)
2. **Double-click**: `RESTART_EVERYTHING.bat`
3. **Wait** for both servers to start
4. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173
5. **Login** and test

### Option 2: Manual Restart

**Step 1: Stop Frontend**
- Go to terminal running `npm run dev`
- Press **Ctrl+C**
- Wait for it to stop

**Step 2: Stop Backend** (if needed)
- Go to terminal running backend
- Press **Ctrl+C**
- Wait for it to stop

**Step 3: Start Backend**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

**Step 4: Start Frontend** (in new terminal)
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 5: Test**
- Open: http://localhost:5173
- Login: admin@hrms.com / password123 / MFA: 123456
- Open Console (F12)
- Look for: "🔄 Auto-refreshing data..."

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and look for these messages:

**On Login:**
```
🔄 Loading data from API...
✅ Data loaded: { employees: 8, departments: 4, ... }
```

**Every 10 Seconds:**
```
🔄 Auto-refreshing data...
✅ Auto-refresh complete: { employees: 8, departments: 4, ... }
```

**On Attendance Page:**
```
🔄 Loading attendance data from API...
✅ Attendance data loaded: 17 records
```

### 2. Test Dashboard Updates

1. Note current employee count
2. Go to Employees page
3. Create new employee
4. Return to Dashboard
5. **Wait 10 seconds**
6. Count should increase ✅

### 3. Test Attendance Sync

1. Open two browser windows
2. Login as Admin in both
3. Go to Attendance in both
4. Mark attendance in Window 1
5. **Wait 10 seconds**
6. Window 2 shows update ✅

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "I restarted but still not working"

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Close ALL browser tabs
4. Restart browser
5. Try again

### Issue 2: "Console shows no auto-refresh messages"

**Solution:**
- Frontend is still running old code
- Make sure you stopped it completely (Ctrl+C)
- Wait 5 seconds after stopping
- Start again with `npm run dev`

### Issue 3: "Backend not responding"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000

# If not running, start it
cd server
npm start
```

### Issue 4: "Port already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 5173 (frontend)
npx kill-port 5173

# Kill process on port 5000 (backend)
npx kill-port 5000

# Then restart
```

## What You Should See After Restart

### Dashboard:
- Numbers update every 10 seconds
- Create/delete operations reflect immediately
- Console shows auto-refresh messages

### Attendance:
- Loads from API on page load
- Updates every 10 seconds
- Changes sync across all users
- Toast notifications on save

### CRUD Operations:
- Create: Saves to API, reloads data
- Update: Saves to API, reloads data
- Delete: Removes from API, reloads data
- All operations visible to all users

## Testing After Restart

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Test dashboard updates
node test-dashboard-updates.js

# Test CRUD operations
node test-crud-operations.js

# Test attendance sync
node test-attendance-sync.js
```

All tests should pass ✅

### Manual Test Checklist:

### Quick Steps:
1. Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)
2. Start frontend (`npm run dev`)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Login and test
