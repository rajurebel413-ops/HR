# Update & Delete Operations - Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

All Update and Delete operations are now working correctly in both backend and frontend.

---

## 🔧 What Was the Problem?

### Root Cause:
MongoDB uses `_id` as the primary key, but the frontend TypeScript code expected `id`. When the frontend tried to update or delete items using `department.id`, it was sending `undefined` to the backend, causing errors.

### Example of the Issue:
```javascript
// Frontend tried to do:
await departmentService.updateDepartment(department.id, data);

// But department.id was undefined because MongoDB only had _id
// So the API call became:
PUT /api/departments/undefined  ❌
```

---

## 🛠️ The Fix

### Added ID Transformation to All Models:

Modified 4 models to include both `id` and `_id` fields:

1. **server/models/Department.js**
2. **server/models/Employee.js**
3. **server/models/LeaveRequest.js**
4. **server/models/Attendance.js**

### Transformation Code Added:
```javascript
{
  timestamps: true,
  toJSON: {
    virtuals: true,
    transform: function(doc, ret) {
      ret.id = ret._id.toString();  // Add id field
      delete ret.__v;                // Remove version key
      return ret;
    }
  }
}
```

### Result:
Now all API responses include both fields:
```json
{
  "id": "6902d1db677d67d6042a95f6",
  "_id": "6902d1db677d67d6042a95f6",
  "name": "Engineering",
  ...
}
```
