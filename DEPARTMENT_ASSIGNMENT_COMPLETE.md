## How It Works

### Creating Employee with Department

**Frontend (EmployeeForm.tsx):**
```typescript
// Step 2: Employment Details
<Select id="departmentId" name="departmentId" required>
    <option value="">Select Department</option>
    {departments.map(d => <option key={d.id} value={d.id}>{d.name}</option>)}
</Select>
```

**Backend (server/routes/employees.js):**
```javascript
// Create employee with departmentId
const employee = await Employee.create({
    employeeId,
    userId: user._id,
    name,
    email,
    departmentId,  // ← Department assigned here
    role,
    // ... other fields
});
```

### Viewing Employees with Departments

**API Response:**
```javascript
// GET /api/employees
// Returns employees with populated department info
{
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "departmentId": {
        "_id": "...",
        "name": "Engineering"  // ← Populated department
    },
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Reassigning Departments

**Update Employee:**
```javascript
// PUT /api/employees/:id
await axios.put(`/api/employees/${employeeId}`, {
    departmentId: newDepartmentId
});
```
