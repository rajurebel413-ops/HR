## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Leave Deletion Restriction
**Problem**: Approved/rejected leaves couldn't be deleted (even by admin)
**Fix**: Modified `server/routes/leaves.js` to allow Admin/HR to delete any leave
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Before: Blocked all non-pending leaves
if (leaveRequest.status !== 'Pending') {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Cannot delete...' });
}

// After: Allow Admin/HR to delete any leave
if (leaveRequest.status !== 'Pending' && 
    req.user.role !== 'Admin' && 
    req.user.role !== 'HR') {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Cannot delete...' });
}
```
