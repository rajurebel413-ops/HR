## 🔧 Development Notes

### Email Configuration (Optional)
If you want to enable real email sending:

1. Edit `server/.env`
2. Update these values:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your_app_specific_password
   SMTP_FROM=noreply@hrms.com
   ```

3. For Gmail, you need to:
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication
   - Generate an App-Specific Password
   - Use that password in SMTP_PASS

### Development Bypass Code
- The code **123456** will always work in development mode
- This bypasses the email requirement
- In production, remove this bypass from `server/routes/auth.js`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Login Shows "Login Failed"
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify backend is running: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- Check backend logs in terminal

### Email Verification Error
- This is expected! Use the bypass code: **123456**
- The purple box on the verification page shows this code

### CRUD Operations Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in (token in localStorage)
- Check backend logs for API errors

### Data Not Showing
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend is connected to MongoDB

---

## 📊 Test Results

All backend APIs have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Authentication & MFA
- ✅ Email Verification (Dev Mode)
- ✅ Departments CRUD
- ✅ Employees CRUD
- ✅ Leaves CRUD
- ✅ Attendance Read

Run `node test-complete-flow-fixed.js` to verify backend APIs anytime.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the frontend login flow
2. Test all CRUD operations in the UI
3. Verify data persistence (refresh page, data should remain)
4. Test different user roles if needed
5. Configure email if you want real email notifications

**Happy Testing! 🎉**
