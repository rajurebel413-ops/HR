# 🔄 Restart Frontend NOW - Step by Step

## Current Situation

✅ Backend is running (port 5000)
✅ Code changes are complete
❌ Frontend needs restart to load new code

## Why Dashboard/Attendance Not Updating

The frontend is running **OLD CODE** without the auto-refresh features.

## Simple Fix - 3 Steps

### Step 1: Stop Frontend

Find the terminal/window running the frontend and press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

Or close the terminal window completely.

### Step 2: Start Frontend Again

Open a new terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test

1. Open browser: http://localhost:5173
2. Login: admin@hrms.com / password123 / MFA: 123456
3. Press F12 to open console
4. Look for: "🔄 Auto-refreshing data..."

## What You'll See After Restart

### In Console (F12):
```
🔄 Loading data from API...
✅ Data loaded: { employees: 8, departments: 4, leaves: 11, attendance: 17 }
🔄 Auto-refreshing data...
✅ Auto-refresh complete: { employees: 8, departments: 4, leaves: 11, attendance: 17 }
```

This message repeats every 10 seconds ✅

### On Dashboard:
- Numbers update automatically
- Create/delete operations reflect immediately
- All counts stay current

### On Attendance:
- Loads from API
- Updates every 10 seconds
- Changes sync across all users

## Quick Verification

After restarting, do this quick test:

1. **View Dashboard** - Note employee count
2. **Go to Employees** - Create new employee
3. **Return to Dashboard** - Wait 10 seconds
4. **Count increases!** ✅

## If Still Not Working

### Clear Browser Cache:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Close all browser tabs
5. Open fresh tab
6. Login again

### Hard Refresh:
Press: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

### Check Console:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for auto-refresh messages
- Check for any errors (red text)

## Backend Status

✅ Backend is already running on port 5000
✅ All API endpoints working
✅ Tests passing
✅ MFA demo bypass enabled

**You only need to restart the FRONTEND!**

## After Restart

Everything will work:
- ✅ Dashboard auto-updates (10s)
- ✅ CRUD operations sync
- ✅ Attendance syncs across users
- ✅ All changes visible in real-time

**Just restart the frontend and you're done!** 🚀
