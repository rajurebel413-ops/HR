## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Updates Not Showing?
1. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   - Look for any error messages
   - Check if API calls are successful (200 status)

2. **Refresh the Page**:
   - Sometimes the UI needs a refresh
   - Data should persist after refresh

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Look at the terminal running the backend
   - Check for any error messages

### Deletes Not Working?
1. **Check if item is protected**:
   - Approved/Rejected leaves cannot be deleted
   - Departments with employees might be protected

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for 400 or 403 errors
   - Read the error message

3. **Verify Authentication**:
   - Make sure you're logged in as Admin/HR
   - Some operations require specific roles

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- ✅ Create: New department appears in list
- ✅ Update: Name changes immediately
- ✅ Delete: Department disappears from list
- ✅ Data persists after page refresh

### Employees:

- ✅ Update: Details change immediately
- ✅ Delete: Employee disappears from list
- ✅ Data persists after page refresh

### Leaves:
- ✅ Create: New leave request appears
- ✅ Update: Status changes (Pending → Approved/Rejected)
- ✅ Delete: Only pending leaves can be deleted
- ✅ Data persists after page refresh

## 📊 Backend Test Results

All backend operations tested and verified:
```
✅ Departments: Create, Read, Update, Delete
✅ Employees: Create, Read, Update, Delete
✅ Leaves: Create, Read, Update, Delete (with protection)
✅ ID Transformation: _id → id (working)
✅ Data Persistence: MongoDB (working)
```

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **ID Transformation**: Added `id` field to all models (alongside `_id`)
2. **JSON Serialization**: Models now return both `id` and `_id`
3. **Frontend Compatibility**: Frontend can now use `department.id`, `employee.id`, etc.
4. **Backend Routes**: All routes properly handle updates and deletes
